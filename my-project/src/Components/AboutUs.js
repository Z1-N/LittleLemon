                    <p className='font-sans hidden md:block font-bold text-pretty md:text-base leading-relaxed mt-4 text-white truncate'>Little Lemon started in the heart of Dublin in 1987, founded by friends passionate about Mediterranean cuisine. They wanted to create a place where Chicagoans could enjoy authentic Mediterranean flavors from Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Lebanon.

Named for the fresh, zesty essence of the Mediterranean, Little Lemon uses the freshest ingredients and traditional methods. Our savory lamb kebabs, creamy hummus, and delicate baklava celebrate true Mediterranean flavors.

Our cozy atmosphere quickly made us a local favorite. From a humble eatery, weâ€™ve grown into a beloved Chicago institution known for warm hospitality and memorable dining.

Today, Little Lemon thrives, staying true to its roots while embracing new culinary innovations. Join us and experience why Little Lemon is a cherished Chicago destination.</p>
